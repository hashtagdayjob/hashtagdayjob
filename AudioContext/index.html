            <h2>Simplethiser</h2>
            <p>
                A very basic synthesiser. Signal chain is from the bottom of the page upwards through the devices.
                Control via the sliders currently has no feedback with regard to actual values and you will probably
                need to be quite familiar with sound engineering or the web audio api to work out the useful ranges
                for values of the sliders.
            </p>
            <p>
                The unit itself has no keyboard, only a trigger button. The pitch must be set with the oscillator
                frequency slider. It is not possible to disable any of the modules completely, it is a very basic
                proof of concept implementation of a synthesiser.

            <h2>Effectstation</h2>
            <p>
                An experiment in implementing a number of common effects in their most basic web audio graph.
                Control via the sliders currently has no feedback with regard to actual values and you will probably
                need to be quite familiar with sound engineering or the web audio api to work out the useful ranges
                for values of the sliders.

            <h2>Flanger</h2>
            <p>
                An experiment in implementing a flanger effect in a complex web audio graph.
                Control via the sliders currently has no feedback but the controls have sensible
                limits for values of the sliders to make the efect usable.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to disable any of the modules completely so that the effects can be
                muted.

                The chorus unit is not a useful implementation yet, I am still working out how to implement it
